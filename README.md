 CuckooML is a project that aims to deliver the possibility to find similarities between malware samples based on static and dynamic analysis features. By using anomaly detection techniques, such mechanism will be able to cluster and identify new types of malware and will constitute an invaluable tool for security researchers. Through the project, state of the art data science and machine learning approaches will be implemented and integrated into the Cuckoo Sandbox and will be made accessible as a command-line toolkit and as a web based interface. 
 
 CuckooML development is supported by the [Google Summer of Code 2016](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and mentored by [The Honeynet Project](https://www.honeynet.org/)
